# Task 5: Enhancing Error Handling in Node.js

## Overview
This task aims to strengthen the error handling mechanisms within a Node.js user login function, allowing for more precise error responses directed at clients.

## Enhancements to Error Handling
1. **Detailed Error Responses**: Improve the function to distinguish between different error situations, such as when a user is not found or an incorrect password is entered, returning suitable HTTP status codes for each case.

2. **Standardized Error Format**: Establish a uniform JSON structure for error responses, ensuring that clients can interpret error messages easily.

3. **Error Logging**: Implement a logging system to capture error details, aiding in debugging and monitoring processes.

4. **Try-Catch Implementation**: Enclose the login logic within try-catch blocks to handle unexpected errors gracefully, preventing potential application crashes.

5. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Deliver user-friendly error messages that are informative yet do not disclose sensitive information, facilitating user understanding and corrective action.

## Significance of Distinguishing Error Types

- **User Experience**: Differentiating between errors such as "user not found" and "invalid password" empowers users to grasp the nature of the problem and take appropriate steps to resolve it.

- **Security**: By avoiding disclosure of which aspect of the login process failed (e.g., whether the username is valid), we reduce the risk of account enumeration attacks.

- **Easy Debugging**: Providing specific error messages helps developers and support teams quickly diagnose and resolve issues within the application.
