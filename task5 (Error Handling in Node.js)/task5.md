# Task 5: Improving Error Handling in Node.js

## Overview
This task is about making error handling better in a Node.js user login function. The goal is to give clearer error messages to clients when something goes wrong.

## Improvements in Error Handling
1. **Clearer Error Messages**: Change the function so it can tell the difference between different problems, like when a user is not found or the password is wrong. It should also send back the right HTTP status codes for each situation.
   
2. **Consistent Error Format**: Set up a standard format for error messages in JSON. This will help clients easily understand what went wrong.
   
3. **Logging Errors**: Use a logging tool to save details about errors. This will help with fixing problems and keeping track of issues.

4. **Using Try-Catch Blocks**: Put the login code inside try-catch blocks. This way, if something unexpected happens, it can be handled without crashing the application.

5. **User-Friendly Messages**: Give users helpful error messages that are easy to understand and do not share any sensitive information. This will help users know what to do next.

## Importance of Differentiating Error Types
- **Better User Experience**: By distinguishing between errors like "user not found" and "invalid password," users can understand the problem and take steps to fix it.
  
- **Improved Security**: Not revealing which part of the login process failed (like whether the username exists) helps protect against risks, such as people trying to guess usernames.
  
- **Easier Debugging and Support**: Clearer error messages make it easier for developers and support teams to quickly find and fix problems in the application.
