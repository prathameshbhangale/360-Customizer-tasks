# Implementing Rate Limiting in a Node.js Application

## Overview
Rate limiting is a crucial technique for controlling the amount of incoming requests to an application. It helps protect against abuse, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and ensures fair usage of resources among users.



## Libraries and Strategies for Rate Limiting

**express-rate-limit**:
- A popular middleware for Express.js that simplifies the implementation of rate limiting. It allows you to set a maximum request limit and specify error messages.
- **Installation**: 
```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

- **Basic Usage**:
```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests
message: {
    error: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
},
});

app.use(limiter); // Apply to all requests
```


# Basic Approach to Implement Rate Limiting in Node.js

1. **Define Rate Limit Criteria**: Establish maximum requests allowed from each user/IP within a specific time frame (e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes).

2. **Use Middleware**: Integrate a rate limiting middleware, such as `express-rate-limit`, to enforce the defined limits on incoming requests.

3. **Store Request Counts**: Maintain request counts in memory or a persistent store like Redis to track the number of requests from each user/IP.

4. **Check and Respond**: For each request, check the stored count against the limit and respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status if exceeded.

5. **Inform Users**: Provide clear feedback in the response to inform users about the rate limit and when they can retry their requests.
